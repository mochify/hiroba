# Hiroba, a Clojure client for Foursquare

Hiroba is a minimalistic Clojure client for the Foursquare REST API.


## Project Goals

* Be feature complete with the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/)
* Be well documented
* Be well tested
* Be Clojuric, relying on Clojure idioms without introducing unnecessary abstractions
* Don't be subject to [NIH Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)
* Be up-to-date with the latest Foursquare API changes

## Project Maturity

Hiroba is in its infancy. It is a new project, with only minimal use in production and testing environments at this point. The API is subject to change at any time, but will stabilize over time.


## Artifacts

Hiroba artifacts are [released to Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.mochify/hiroba). If you are using Maven, add the following repository
definition to your `pom.xml`:

``` xml
<repository>
  <id>clojars.org</id>
  <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
```

## Development

Hiroba uses [Leiningen

sure you have it installed and then run tests against supported
Clojure versions using

    lein2 all test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done
with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request on GitHub.
